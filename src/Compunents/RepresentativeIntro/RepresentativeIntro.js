                <p className="repPara">The International Student Foundation (ISF) is a 501(c)(3) organization, whose mission is to transform today’s orphaned and aged-out foster care students into tomorrow’s leaders.  ISF leverages the power of education, mentoring, and leadership development to empower students to do what less than 3% of foster care students achieve: a college degree that can become the springboard to a life of influence and significance.  ISF students receive a SCHOLARSHIP that helps them stay in school, a MENTOR who helps them navigate this crucial season of their journey, and a LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT program that includes an annual Leadership & Life Skills Retreat and a cross-cultural mission trip serving orphans in resource-challenged parts of the world.  In the past 10 years, ISF has awarded scholarships to 98 students, celebrated the graduation of 45 student-leaders, and currently has 51 students studying in 16 different states. ISF is committed to “changing the world – one student at a time!”</p>
